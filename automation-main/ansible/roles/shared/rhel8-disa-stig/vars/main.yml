# Default DISA STIG configuration variables file for the 'rhel8-disa-stig' Ansible role.
# All DISA STIG configuration variables in this file are set to 'false' so that specific STIGs can be applied selectively.

# This variable defines which variable files get included and in which specific order. This is selected via the 'application_preset_selection' variable.
# If multiple files are defined for a certain application preset selection, then those files are applied sequentially. So for example, the following
# would be selected via the 'application_preset_selection=hana' variable and variables in the 'hana.yml' variables file would overwrite variables in
# the 'primary.yml' variables.
#     hana: [ primary.yml, hana.yml ]
product_stig_map:
  none: [main.yml]          # This is the default if 'application_preset_selection' is not specified; No stigs enabled. Use this to apply singular IDs.

## Configuration for shared credential.
## Default credential strategy will be used if it is absent here:
##            Instance role is used for EC2 case by default.
##            AmazonCloudWatchAgent profile is used for onPremise case by default.

## Configuration for proxy.
## System-wide environment-variable will be read if it is absent here.
## i.e. HTTP_PROXY/http_proxy; HTTPS_PROXY/https_proxy; NO_PROXY/no_proxy
## Note: system-wide environment-variable is not accessible when using ssm run-command.
## Absent in both here and environment-variable means no proxy will be used.

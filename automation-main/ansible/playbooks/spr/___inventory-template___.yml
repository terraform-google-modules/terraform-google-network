# Synopsis: EXAMPLE Inventory
# Inputs: N/A
# Outputs: N/A
# Comments:
#   - Be sure to include the defaults.yml as an additional inventory.
#   Nomenclature:
#     Inventory Hostnames:
#       Inventory Hostnames will be the unique identifier used in the backend.  It will be registered to backend DNS and used by all automation.  This may be different from the application/OS hostname.
#       Inventory Hostnames use the following structure:
#         ccccTTTnnSSS
#           cccc - The first four characters are reserved for the (security boundary) unique customer identifier
#           TTT - The next 3 characters will be either `db` (database type) or `app` (application type)
#           nn - If type `app` the next 2 characters will be the node number starting from 01
#           SSS - The final 3 characters are reserved for the SID
#       SPR Hostnames:
#         SPR Hostnames are the internal os/application aware hostnames and follow Ops teams syntax. It is not used by automation.
#         SPR Hostnames should follow operational guidelines for naming schema. There has been precedence for being overwritten by Customer naming. Current precedence is as follows:
#           oooSSStttNNN
#             ooo - Organization Identifier
#             SSS - Sid
#             ttt - Type `db` (database type) or `app` (application type)
#             NNN - Node number

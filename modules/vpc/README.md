# Terraform VPC Module

This submodule is part of the the `terraform-google-network` module. It creates a vpc network and optionally enables it as a Shared VPC host project.

It supports creating:

- A VPC Network
- Optionally enabling the network as a Shared VPC host

## Usage

Basic usage of this submodule is as follows:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
    source  = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc"
    version = "~> 2.0.0"

    project_id   = "<PROJECT ID>"
    network_name = "example-vpc"

    shared_vpc_host = false
}
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| auto\_create\_subnetworks | When set to true, the network is created in 'auto subnet mode' and it will create a subnet for each region automatically across the 10.128.0.0/9 address range. When set to false, the network is created in 'custom subnet mode' so the user can explicitly connect subnetwork resources. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| delete\_default\_internet\_gateway\_routes | If set, ensure that all routes within the network specified whose names begin with 'default-route' and with a next hop of 'default-internet-gateway' are deleted | `bool` | `false` | no |
| description | An optional description of this resource. The resource must be recreated to modify this field. | `string` | `""` | no |
| enable\_ipv6\_ula | Enabled IPv6 ULA, this is a permenant change and cannot be undone! (default 'false') | `bool` | `false` | no |
| internal\_ipv6\_range | When enabling IPv6 ULA, optionally, specify a /48 from fd20::/20 (default null) | `string` | `null` | no |
| mtu | The network MTU (If set to 0, meaning MTU is unset - defaults to '1460'). Recommended values: 1460 (default for historic reasons), 1500 (Internet default), or 8896 (for Jumbo packets). Allowed are all values in the range 1300 to 8896, inclusively. | `number` | `0` | no |
| network\_firewall\_policy\_enforcement\_order | Set the order that Firewall Rules and Firewall Policies are evaluated. Valid values are `BEFORE_CLASSIC_FIREWALL` and `AFTER_CLASSIC_FIREWALL`. (default null or equivalent to `AFTER_CLASSIC_FIREWALL`) | `string` | `null` | no |
| network\_name | The name of the network being created | `string` | n/a | yes |
| network\_profile | "A full or partial URL of the network profile to apply to this network.<br>This field can be set only at resource creation time. For example, the<br>following are valid URLs:<br>  * https://www.googleapis.com/compute/beta/projects/{projectId}/global/networkProfiles/{network_profile_name}<br>  * projects/{projectId}/global/networkProfiles/{network\_profile\_name} | `string` | `null` | no |
| project\_id | The ID of the project where this VPC will be created | `string` | n/a | yes |
| routing\_mode | The network routing mode (default 'GLOBAL') | `string` | `"GLOBAL"` | no |
| shared\_vpc\_host | Makes this project a Shared VPC host if 'true' (default 'false') | `bool` | `false` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| network | The VPC resource being created |
| network\_id | The ID of the VPC being created |
| network\_name | The name of the VPC being created |
| network\_self\_link | The URI of the VPC being created |
| project\_id | VPC project id |
